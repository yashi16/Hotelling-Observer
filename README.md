# Hotelling-Observer
I have modified this particular code of Channelized Hotelling Observer to implement Hotelling Observer. I have also added one image which is adding gaussian white noise image. The code was this -> https://github.com/DIDSR/IQmodelo
#########################################################################################################################################
It is basically a project which is generating a random image and then generating gaussian white noise image and then i have applied Hotelling observer.
The Hotelling Observer is a linear classifier that computes a test statistics for choosing between 2 hypothesis in a cardiac perfusion-detect-detection task-defect person H1 and defect absent H0 - based on the observed feature vector.
